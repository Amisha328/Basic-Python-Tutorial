# What is Console in Python? 

# Console (also called Shell) is basically a command line interpreter that takes input from the user.
# If it is error free then it runs the command and gives required output otherwise shows the error message. 

# To take input from the user we make use of a built-in function input().

# input
input1 = input()

# output
print(input1)
