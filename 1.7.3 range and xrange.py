# range() and xrange() are two functions that could be used to iterate a certain number of times in for loops in Python.

# In Python 3, there is no xrange , but the range function behaves like xrange in Python 2.

# range() - This returns a range object (a type of iterable).
# xrange() - This function returns the generator object that can be used to display numbers only by looping.
#            Only particular range is displayed on demand and hence called "lazy evaluation".
