# Python's memory allocation and deallocation method is automatic.

# The literal value 9 is an object.
# The reference count of object 9 is incremented to 1 in line 1.
# In line 2 its reference count becomes zero as it is dereferenced.
# So garbage collector deallocates the object.

# Literal 9 is an object
b = 9

# Reference count of object 9 
# becomes 0.
b = 4
