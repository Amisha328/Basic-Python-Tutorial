# What is Console in Python? 

# Console (also called Shell) is basically a command line interpreter that takes input from the user.
# If it is error free then it runs the command and gives required output otherwise shows the error message. 

# To take input from the user we make use of a built-in function input().
# Input multiple values from user in one line.

def main():
    
    # One solution is to use raw_input() two times.
    x, y = input(),  input()
